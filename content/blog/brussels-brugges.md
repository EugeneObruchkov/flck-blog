We bought tickets for The Smile concert featuring Thom Yorke and set off for a short adventure in Belgium.

The weather, unfortunately, wasn’t on our side - it remained gloomy and rainy throughout our trip.

Brussels left us with mixed impressions. On one hand, it’s a grand city with magnificent architecture that tells stories of its rich past. On the other, the streets were cluttered with trash, and the sheer number of questionable characters wandering around made us feel uneasy at times. Not all districts of Brussels are as inviting as its historic center.

Bruges, however, turned out to be a delightful surprise. We took a train from Brussels and, despite the persistent drizzle and the inevitable crowds of tourists, the city welcomed us with its quiet charm and immaculate streets.

The atmosphere was almost surreal - just like stepping into a scene from [In Bruges](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/).

We’ll definitely try to return here again - this place deserves another visit!
