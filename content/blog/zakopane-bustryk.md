We spent a ten days on a workation in the stunning Tatra Mountains of Poland.

Our home for the week was a cozy villa in the charming village of Bustryk:

The view from our window was absolutely breathtaking!

We spent a few days snowboarding, exploring different slopes - including one across the border in Slovakia.

The snow conditions weren’t ideal - I’d rate them around 4/10, but that didn’t stop us from having fun on the slopes.
